### The D&D Magnum Opus
     "I've been playing Dungeons & Dragons for that past 8ish years, mostly as the DM,
     and I have started to tired of running the same system. So I decided to make my greatest campaign
     and then switch to a different system."

### Stars Without Number
     "For the past 3 months I've been slowly creating a world to run the Stars Without Number game system.
     I would like to finish it so that once I've finished with my D&D Magnum Opus I can switch over without
     a long delay between games."
